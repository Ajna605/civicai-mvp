The minimum or lowest quality acceptable peakperiod* operating LOS standards for State Principal Arterial, Minor Arterial, County Minor Arterial, County and City Collector roads within the City shall be the minimum acceptable peakperiod LOS standard:\n\nWhere public transit service does not exist, roadways shall operate at or above LOS E; within the Special Transportation Area (STA) twenty (20%) percent of nonState roads may operate below LOS E.\n\nWhere public transit service having headways of twenty (20) minutes or less is provided within 1/2 mile distance, roadways shall operate at no greater than one-hundred twenty (120%) percent of their capacity.\n\nWhere commuter rail or express bus public transit service exists, generally parallel roads within 1/2 mile shall operate at no greater than one-hundred fifty (150%) percent of their capacity.\n\n* Peak period means the average of the two highest consecutive hours of traffic volume during a weekday.\n\nSanitary Sewer LOS. Existing sanitary sewer systems within the jurisdiction of the City shall be operated at a LOS not less restrictive than that provided for in the Miami-Dade County Comprehensive Master Plan, as amended. All sanitary sewer systems within the jurisdiction of the City shall be operated to provide at least the minimum LOS as described herein:\n\nThe Miami-Dade County regional wastewater treatment and disposal system shall operate with a design capacity of two (2) above average daily flow for the preceding year.\n\nEffluent discharged from Miami-Dade County wastewater treatment plants shall meet all federal, State, and County standards.\n\nThe local system shall maintain the design capacity to collect and dispose of one-hundred thirty-five (135) gallons of sewage per capita, per day.\n\nAll collection and treatment facilities shall maintain the capacity to transport and treat peak demand flow without overflow.\n\nThe City shall coordinate with Miami-Dade County to assess and implement the feasibility of providing sanitary sewer services in compliance with Section 163.3177, F.S, and Section 24-43.4 of the Code of Miami-Dade County. The City shall have Level of Service (LOS) standards to be consistent with County’s LOS requirements as outlined in Miami-Dade County Comprehensive Plan, ensuring alignment with regional regulations and applicable federal, state, and local environmental protection standards.\n\nSolid Waste LOS. The City shall maintain nominal collection services at the following levels of service: Residential pickup is to be twice a week for household waste, once per week for recycling, and once per week for trash; Commercial service provided by private contract service, shall continue at a level of service as agreed upon by the parties, not less than once per week. In cooperation with the Miami-Dade County, the City shall provide and maintain a minimum acceptable LOS for Solid Waste collection at an annual average design generation rate of five (5 lbs) pounds per capita per day for residential service, one half (0.5 lbs) pound per capita per day for residential recycling, and seven (7 lbs) pounds per capita per day for non-residential service. Certification of the availability and commitment of capacity by MiamiDade and applicable private vendors shall be sufficient to demonstrate that such facilities are available to the site, during the concurrency review process.\n\nDrainage LOS. The minimum acceptable Flood Protection LOS standards for the City shall be protection from the degree of flooding that would result for duration of one day from a ten-year storm. All structures shall be constructed at, or above, the minimum floor elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Coral Gables in Miami-Dade County, Florida. All new development must retain at least the first one (1\") inch of storm water runoff onsite, or other nonpublic sites as may be secured for permanent services. Designs to meet this first inch criteria will be reviewed for design solutions to meet actual site conditions. The burden for the construction of such facilities shall be borne by the developer and/or owner of such sites. Failure of such facilities and subsequent corrections shall also be the responsibility of the developer and owner. The City may require greater than the first one inch onsite retention where the City establishes more restrictive rules in the public interest.\n\nPotable Water LOS. The minimum acceptable LOS standards of potable water shall be 165 gallons per day per capita and such water is to be delivered to users at a pressure of not less than twenty pounds per square inch (psi) and not greater than one-hundred (100) psi. The regional treatment system shall operate with a rated capacity which is no less than two (2%) percent above the maximum day flow for the preceding year. Water quality shall meet or exceed all federal, state, and County primary standards for potable water; and system wide storage capacity for finished water shall equal no less than fifteen (15%) percent of the Countywide average daily demand.\n\nFire Protection LOS. The minimum acceptable LOS standards of fire protection shall be as follows:\n\nMinimum fire flows shall be maintained at not less than:\n\n500 gpm in single-family residential areas of densities of less than 5.8 units per acre.\n\n750 gpm for single-family and duplex residential areas at densities of 5.8 dwelling units per acre or more.\n\n1500 gpm in multifamily residential and low intensity commercial areas of two (2) floors or less.\n\n3000 gpm in all other commercial and industrial areas.\n\nAutomatic fire suppression systems shall be required in all buildings of six floors or more.\n\nAdequate Water Distribution LOS Standards. The City shall seek to provide adequate water distribution and hydrants for all existing and new areas annexed and serviced by the Fire Department. All existing and new water distribution systems, fire hydrants and flows shall be in compliance with the National Fire Protection Standards (NFPA) and Insurance Services Office (ISO) requirements, as amended.\n\nRecreation LOS Standards. Maintain the existing level of services provided by recreation programs and activities to meet the continuing needs of all residents. The minimum acceptable LOS standards for recreation and open space facilities will be measured by the following radius standards:\n\n| Recreation facilities radius standard: | Recreation facilities radius standard: | Recreation facilities radius standard: |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Park Type | Acreage/Mileage | Service Radius |\n| Urban Open Spaces | 0 - .25 | 5 minute walk or 0 .25 miles |\n| Neighborhood Park | .25 - 3 | 10 minute walk or 0.5 miles |\n| Community Facilities | 3 – 100 | 15 minute drive or 5 miles |\n| Beach/Waterway Access | N/A | 20 minute drive or 6.7 miles |\n| Non-City District/Regional | Varies | 30 minute drive or 10 miles |\n| Trail Ways | At least 100’ in length | 10 minute walk or 0.5 miles |\n| Private Park/ Recreation Facilities | Varies | 10 minute drive or 3.3 miles |\n\nUrban Open Spaces are those designated areas which are between 0 and .25 acres and typically contain landscaped areas but have very limited or no facilities or other improvements. The recreational use of these sites is limited by their location and/or size. These sites serve to preserve the aesthetic quality of an area or to intersperse congested urban environments with aesthetically pleasing buffer areas. Some open space areas may serve as linear parks or vest pocket parks, while other areas are parkways, boulevard medians, plazas, malls, courthouse squares and promenades.\n\nNeighborhood Parks those designated areas that are “walk-to” facilities where residents may walk or bicycle to the park within a given neighborhood. Areas for diverse recreational activities which may include, but are not limited to the following: field games; court games; sports fields; playground apparatus area; picnic area; landscaping and gardens areas; and senior citizen areas. The Neighborhood Park is a place where neighbors and their families go to meet.\n\nCommunity Facilities is an area that provides a diverse range of recreational and leisure activities or provides very specific active recreation facilities for all individuals and families. Facilities and activities may include, but are not limited to athletic fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, performing and community centers. These facilities are designed to meet the recreation needs of the entire community.\n\nNon-City District/Regional Parks is an area selected for its natural and ornamental quality and its suitability of which the purpose is to function as a regionally-based recreational activity area. Recreational activities could include, but not be limited to, swimming, picnicking, camping, boating, fishing, and a variety of trail uses.\n\nPublic School Facilities LOS: Coordinate new residential development with the future availability of public school facilities consistent with the adopted level of service (LOS) standards for public school concurrency to ensure the inclusion of those projects necessary to address existing deficiencies in the 5-year schedule of capital improvements, and meet future needs based upon achieving and maintaining the adopted level of service standards throughout the planning period. Beginning January 1, 2008, the adopted LOS standard for all Miami-Dade County Public Schools facilities is 100% utilization of Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH) Capacity (with relocatable classrooms). This LOS standard, except for magnet schools, shall be applicable in each public school concurrency service area (CSA), defined as the public school attendance boundary established by Miami-Dade County Public Schools.\n\nThe adopted LOS standard for Magnet Schools is 100% of FISH (With Relocatable Classrooms), which shall be calculated on a districtwide basis.\n\nLOS standards for public school facilities apply to those traditional educational facilities, owned and operated by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, that are required to serve the residential development within their established Concurrency Service Area. LOS standards do not apply to charter schools, however, the capacity of both charter and magnet schools is credited against the impact of development. No credit against the impact of development shall be given for either magnet or charter schools if their enrollment is at, or above, 100% FISH capacity.\n\nCertification of the availability and commitment of capacity by Miami-Dade County Public Schools during the concurrency review process shall be sufficient to demonstrate that such facilities are available to meet the impacts of a residential development.\n\n(Ord.
