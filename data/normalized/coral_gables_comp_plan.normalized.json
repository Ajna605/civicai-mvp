The minimum acceptable Flood Protection LOS standards for the City shall be\nprotection from the degree of flooding that would result for duration of one day from a ten-year\nstorm. All structures shall be constructed at, or above, the minimum floor elevation specified in the\nFlood Insurance Rate Maps for Coral Gables in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Failure of such facilities and\nsubsequent corrections shall also be the responsibility of the developer and owner. The City may\nrequire greater than the first one inch onsite retention where the City establishes more restrictive\nrules in the public interest.\n\nPotable Water LOS. The minimum acceptable LOS standards of potable water shall be 165 gallons\nper day per capita and such water is to be delivered to users at a pressure of not less than twenty\npounds per square inch (psi) and not greater than one-hundred (100) psi.

The minimum acceptable LOS standards of fire protection shall be as follows:\n• Minimum fire flows shall be maintained at not less than:\n• 500 gpm in single-family residential areas of densities of less than 5.8 units per acre.\n• 750 gpm for single-family and duplex residential areas at densities of 5.8 dwelling units per\nacre or more.\n• 1500 gpm in multifamily residential and low intensity commercial areas of two (2) floors or\nless.\n• 3000 gpm in all other commercial and industrial areas.\n• Automatic fire suppression systems shall be required in all buildings of six floors or more.\n\nAdequate Water Distribution LOS Standards.

All existing and new water distribution systems, fire hydrants and flows shall be in\ncompliance with the National Fire Protection Standards (NFPA) and Insurance Services Office (ISO)\nrequirements, as amended.\n\nRecreation LOS Standards.

The\nrecreational use of these sites is limited by their location and/or size. These sites serve to preserve\nthe aesthetic quality of an area or to intersperse congested urban environments with aesthetically\npleasing buffer areas. Some open space areas may serve as linear parks or vest pocket parks, while\nother areas are parkways, boulevard medians, plazas, malls, courthouse squares and promenades.\n\nNeighborhood Parks those designated areas that are “walk-to” facilities where residents may walk\nor bicycle to the park within a given neighborhood. Areas for diverse recreational activities which\nmay include, but are not limited to the following: field games; court games; sports fields;\nplayground apparatus area; picnic area; landscaping and gardens areas; and senior citizen areas.\nThe Neighborhood Park is a place where neighbors and their families go to meet.\n\nCommunity Facilities is an area that provides a diverse range of recreational and leisure activities or\nprovides very specific active recreation facilities for all individuals and families. Facilities and\nactivities may include, but are not limited to athletic fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums,\nperforming and community centers. These facilities are designed to meet the recreation needs of\nthe entire community.\n\nNon-City District/Regional Parks is an area selected for its natural and ornamental quality and its\nsuitability of which the purpose is to function as a regionally-based recreational activity area.\nRecreational activities could include, but not be limited to, swimming, picnicking, camping, boating,\nfishing, and a variety of trail uses.\n\nPublic School Facilities LOS: Coordinate new residential development with the future availability of\npublic school facilities consistent with the adopted level of service (LOS) standards for public school\nconcurrency to ensure the inclusion of those projects necessary to address existing deficiencies in\nthe 5-year schedule of capital improvements, and meet future needs based upon achieving and\nmaintaining the adopted level of service standards throughout the planning period. Beginning\nJanuary 1, 2008, the adopted LOS standard for all Miami-Dade County Public Schools facilities is\n100% utilization of Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH) Capacity (with relocatable\nclassrooms). This LOS standard, except for magnet schools, shall be applicable in each public school\nconcurrency service area (CSA), defined as the public school attendance boundary established by\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools.\n\nThe adopted LOS standard for Magnet Schools is 100% of FISH (With Relocatable Classrooms),\nwhich shall be calculated on a districtwide basis.\n\nLOS standards for public school facilities apply to those traditional educational facilities, owned and\noperated by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, that are required to serve the residential\ndevelopment within their established Concurrency Service Area. LOS standards do not apply to\ncharter schools, however, the capacity of both charter and magnet schools is credited against the\nimpact of development. No credit against the impact of development shall be given for either\nmagnet or charter schools if their enrollment is at, or above, 100% FISH capacity.\n\nCertification of the availability and commitment of capacity by Miami-Dade County Public Schools\nduring the concurrency review process shall be sufficient to demonstrate that such facilities are\navailable to meet the impacts of a residential development.\n(Ord.
